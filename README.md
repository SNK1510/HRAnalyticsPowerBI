# HR Analytics using PowerBI

HR Analytics is another term for Workforce/People Analytics and is the collection and application of employee data to make decisions around workforce planning. This involves gathering the right data, transforming it, devising suitable KPIs, and visualizing them.
Some use cases of HR Analytics are,

- Identifying gaps in skills: With 'Quiet Hiring' on the rise, identifying general skill deficits or surpluses can help organizations plan learning and development courses
- Analyzing Employee Attrition and its risk: Understanding leading factors for why employees voluntarily leave and how this could have been avoided. Historic data can also be used for predictive analysis to gauge the chance of a current employee leaving based on exhibited behavior
- Improving Hiring: A typical hiring process consists of posting a job, going through applications, screening candidates, and conducting interviews. Data collected at each step, like questions asked, match % of candidate profiles with the Job Description and can be analyzed to understand if they assess candidates well based on their current performance

In this project, I will be taking up one of the use cases of HR Analytics, which is to understand employee behavior and identify underlying patterns,

- Working preference of employees: On-site or remote?
- Working location vs day preferred
- Nature of sick leaves taken

This is a guided project by [Dhaval Patel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru1qeDO_qrc&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuVQccZa7yFwK3ltoGQOWbM). The Dataset used is an Attendance sheet shared by the HR of Atliq.

We are using Power BI to transform this data and address the above topics
